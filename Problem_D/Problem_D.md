Problem D
---------

Today's problem will have a little bit of coding in it, since we're slowly starting to get the hang of git. 

The problem is a nice simple one: 

Write a function that takes in a number and computes the factorial of that number. 
The factorial (!) is the multiplication of all the numbers from one from that number, so: 

```
1! = 1 = 1
2! = 1*2 = 2
3! = 1*2*3 = 6
4! = 1*2*3*4 = 24
5! = 1*2*3*4*5 = 120
```
